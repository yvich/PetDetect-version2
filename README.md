## Goal 

pets are very valuable creatures and multiple people tend to be concern when they leave their pets by themselves in the house. In this group , we thought about a way for people to monitor their pets . 
Hence , this is the creation of an android app that helps any user to monitor their pets in the house. Basically , the user will know precisely the location of the pet by selecting the different doors in the house. The user will be able to receive notifications when the pet cross the door. The motion detection will be done with a combinaison of motion and distance sensors . He will be able to identify the pet with the image received from the camera module pulled from firebase. This application will be scaled in the future.
